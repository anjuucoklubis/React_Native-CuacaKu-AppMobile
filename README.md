# React_Native-CuacaKu-AppMobile

The weather app I created using Open API and React Native is an innovative solution that gives users instant access to accurate and up-to-date weather information. With a user-friendly and responsive user interface built with React Native, users can easily search and view weather forecasts for their current location or other cities around the world. The app combines weather data from Open APIs with an attractive and simple design, allowing users to gain a quick and easy understanding of weather conditions, temperature, humidity and long-term forecasts.


>**Note**: This application was built and developed by [Anju Lubis](https://anjulubis.vercel.app/). This application was built starting from September 2023 and in Oktober 2023 this application has met the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) value and is suitable for use and published with version 0.0.1

## Prerequisites

Install node + android studio & emulator

[Install npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

[Install android studio & emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio)


## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of  project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.


## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and used app
